#Topic Summary
Game developers often overlook the crucial step of analyzing the market before picking the genre of
game they choose to develop. This often leads to developers entering oversaturated markets; their
titles, consequently, flounder. This project seeks to provide a breakdown of revenue statistics from the
popular platform Steam, and determine what genres are oversaturated and which are underutilized by
examining the revenue associated with each tag. The results should be enlightening for game companies
and independent developers alike, with the results most pertinent to smaller studios.
