  **Topic Summary** <br>
  Game developers often overlook the crucial step of analyzing the market before picking the genre of
  game they choose to develop. This often leads to developers entering oversaturated markets; their
  titles, consequently, flounder. This project seeks to provide a breakdown of revenue statistics from the
  popular platform Steam, and determine what genres are oversaturated and which are underutilized by
  examining the revenue associated with each tag. The results should be enlightening for game companies
  and independent developers alike, with the results most pertinent to smaller studios.
