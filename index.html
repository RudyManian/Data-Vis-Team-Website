 <h2>Topic Summary</h2> 
 <p>
 Game developers often overlook the crucial step of analyzing the market before picking the genre of
 game they choose to develop. This often leads to developers entering oversaturated markets; their
 titles, consequently, flounder. This project seeks to provide a breakdown of revenue statistics from the
 popular platform Steam, and determine what genres are oversaturated and which are underutilized by
 examining the revenue associated with each tag. The results should be enlightening for game companies
 and independent developers alike, with the results most pertinent to smaller studios. <br>
