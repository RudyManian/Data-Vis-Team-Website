   Game developers often overlook the crucial step of analyzing the market before picking the genre of
   game they choose to develop. This often leads to developers entering oversaturated markets; their
   titles, consequently, flounder. This project seeks to provide a breakdown of revenue statistics from the
   popular platform Steam, and determine what genres are oversaturated and which are underutilized by 
   examining the revenue associated with each tag. The results should be enlightening for game companies and 
   independent developers alike, with the results most pertinent to smaller studios. <br>

   </b> The graph shows the total number of games produced by each genre in the year 2016 and the total amount of copies sold by each genre. The action genre has by far the most games produced at 178 but comes second in copies sold at 30 million. The shooter genre sold the most copies at 38 million. Adventure, Role-Playing, Shooter, and Sports games all have similar number of games produced between 47 and 56, but the amount of copies sold between those four genres varies from 3.8 million to 38.2 million. <br>

The only exceptions are in the adventure, Role-playing, and miscellaneous genres. The platform and sports genre stand out as there is a significantly lower user score than critic scores. The highest rated genres on average are Strategy and Role-playing while the lowest scoring genres are Platform and Simulation games. <br>

   </b> While indie, or independantly developed, games in general make less than other genres, the difference between these games and the industry average tends to be low. Especially for games that make under $100k, the difference between genres is minimal. Most genres generate similair revenue on average. The exception here is casual games, which overall are more likely to make less total revenue than other genres. Knowing this, game developers for casual games should try to keep the costs of developing publishing their down as a high budget production is likely to have a poor return on interest for this genre. <br>

   </b> At the top end of game revenues, independant and casual games make far less revenue than other genres. This is reasonable, as they tend to have lower cost of production, far less marketing and a lack of pre-existing fan base to generate excitement and spread word of their game. This should not discourage these developers, however, as many of the games within this price range tend to be large titles from established studios who, while bringing in more revnue, also have far higher costs. In general, indie and casual games do not tend to compete with these games or for their players.  <br>

   </b> Although the correlation established here is relatively intuitive, it is important to challenge all conventional wisdom with regards to game development to ensure they are correct. Revenue was averaged between neighbors to reduce variance and better show the trend of revenue increasing with user score. It is also important to note that Average revenue of games is different from Median revenue from games, which is better illustrated by other visualizations. <br>

   </b> Tags with few titles is defined as tags with under 50 games. Including those leads to odd outliers such as Wrestling or Submarine being the most successful genres, though perhaps it could be argued that this is an underserved market. Also excluded from this visualization were non-game related tags such as Documentary & Software, as they are outside the bounds of this project. Many of the most successful tags are self-evident staples of the video game medium: survival, crafting, and combat games. Meanwhile, the least successful tags were those that can largely be regarded as a disadvantage. Text-Based means that a game lacks graphics. Minimalist can be interpreted as low-effort by users. Time-Management and Hidden Object are simply unfun mechanics.
